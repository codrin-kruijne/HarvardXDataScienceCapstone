This report has been prepared for the [HarvardX Data Science program] ](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science) Capstone course final project submission and consists of three files of original work that can be found on GitHub (with all commits): this [report in PDF](), this [report in R markdown] and an [R markdown script file]() with all the code (also [knitted to PDF with results]() for convenience). Next to the course requirements my learning goal was to get familir with parallel processing and explore using [AutoML](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html) with [H2O in R](https://cran.r-project.org/package=h2o).
